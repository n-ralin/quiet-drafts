# 2025 Notes

Fragments of structural reasoning emerging across the year —
not conclusions, but quiet architectures.
Each piece examines a pressure point where institutions, incentives,
and collective behaviour drift out of alignment.

These notes do not form a sequence.
They are coordinates.

## Institutional Dynamics

### **Institutional Stability Under Acceleration**
What happens when governance tempos and societal tempos diverge —
a study of lag, friction, and compensatory overreach.  
→ [Read](institutional-stability-under-acceleration.md "Open institutional stability")

---

### **Post-Growth Institutional Dynamics**
A sketch of organisational behaviour when growth is no longer
an operative assumption but a boundary condition.  
→ [Read](post-growth-institutional-dynamics.md "Open post-growth dynamics")

---

### **Fixed-Cost Map**
A structural reading of why fixed costs dominate political debate,
and how they shape both strategic drift and decision horizons.  
→ [Read](fixed-cost-map.md "Open fixed-cost map")

---

### **AHV / Long-Horizon Stability**
Explores intergenerational load distribution and the hidden mechanics
of demographic time — beyond political cycles.  
→ [Read](ahv-25-draft.md "Open AHV draft")

---

## Democracy Load

### **Quality Layers in Direct Democracy**
How signal quality degrades or strengthens across initiation,
public debate, expert input, and vote.  
→ [Read](quality-layers-direct-democracy.md "Open quality layers")

---

### **Voting Load Map**
A quiet model of cognitive load in high-frequency voting systems:
bandwidth, fatigue, and structural overwhelm.  
→ [Read](voting-load-map.md "Open voting load map")

---

## Fiscal Structures

### **Land-Value Shift**
How shifts in land valuation reshape public finance,
and why spatial dynamics resist linear policy tools.  
→ [Read](land-value-shift.md "Open land-value shift")

---

### **Tax Neutrality Constraints**
A map of the structural limits behind “neutrality” as a fiscal ideal —
where the concept holds and where it quietly collapses.  
→ [Read](tax-neutrality-constraints.md "Open tax neutrality constraints")
