# AHV 2.5 – Draft

On how a pay-as-you-go pension system could remain stable without demographic expansion.

Not a proposal. Not a position.

Just a model.

## 1. Core idea

- A pay-as-you-go system that remains stable without growth pressure
- Broader funding through tiny contributions on large realised gains (high thresholds)
- Flexible retirement corridor (63–70) with protection for physically demanding work
- Recognition of long-term care responsibilities
- Early micro-adjustments instead of large cyclical reforms

## 2. Why it matters

Most pension systems assume continuous population growth.

Demographic projections indicate long-term stagnation or decline.

This model tests whether system stability can be maintained through design rather than demographic expansion.

## 3. Minimal conditions

- Wealth-gain thresholds high enough to exclude households and SMEs
- No automatic benefit reductions under any circumstances
- Transparent yearly parameters
- Clear criteria for physically demanding occupations
- Stable administrative load (no new agencies needed)

## 4. Potential failure modes

- Misinterpretation as an anti-migration or anti-family design
- Political reframing toward “hidden taxation”
- Administrative overload for assessing work histories
- Regional inequalities if labour markets diverge
- Long-term behavioural drift (delayed workforce participation)

## 5. Open questions

- Which realised gains should be included or excluded?
- How should care work be operationalised across regions?
- What is the optimal width of a retirement corridor?
- How resilient is the model under economic contraction?
- Could the micro-adjustment rule be simplified further?
- Where does the model introduce unintended incentives?

(Work in progress.)
