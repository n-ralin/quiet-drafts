# **Quality Layers in Direct Democracy – Draft**

A quiet note on the layers that sustains democratic signal quality under increased decision load.

---

## **1. Core idea**

Direct democratic systems generate cognitive and procedural load.

This load increases when proposal quality, information clarity and legislative sequencing are inconsistent.

Quality layers can reduce systemic noise without altering democratic rights.

---

## **2. Mechanism set**

- **Pre-Legislative Analysis:** structural clarity before public debate
- **Validity Screening:** coherence and implementability of initiative texts
- **Impact Sheets:** standardised functional summaries during voting
- **Cooling-Off Layer:** return of incomplete proposals for revision

These mechanisms operate *upstream* of decision-making and do not constrain voter sovereignty.

---

## **3. Minimal conditions**

- transparent, non-interpretative criteria
- no content evaluation
- machine-readable formats
- full publication of procedures and outcomes
- separation of technical and political functions

---

## **4. Potential failure modes**

- perceived reduction of popular rights
- insufficient transparency in screening logic
- over-centralisation of procedural control
- capture by political actors
- unclear assignment of responsibility
- increased administrative complexity

---

## **5. Compatibility factors**

- neutral language
- non-discretionary rules
- low procedural friction
- open access to all intermediate artefacts
- no dependency on expert judgement
- optional adoption sequences (federal or cantonal piloting)

---

## **6. Structural progression (non-predictive)**

*(optional, non-linear, non-prescriptive)*

- increased pre-decision clarity → reduced cognitive load
- reduced cognitive load → more stable choice patterns
- higher textual quality → fewer downstream conflicts
- fewer downstream conflicts → lower systemic noise
- lower systemic noise → improved institutional resilience under plateau conditions

These links indicate possible interactions, not outcomes.

---

## **7. Open questions**

- What level of procedural transparency maintains trust without overloading users?
- How sensitive are different voter groups to upstream quality layers?
- Which mechanisms scale across cantonal variation?
- How does reduced systemic noise affect long-term democratic legitimacy?
- Which indicators best measure cognitive load in direct-democratic settings?
