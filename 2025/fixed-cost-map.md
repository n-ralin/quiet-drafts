# **Fixed-Cost Map – Draft**

A minimal outline of cost structures that remain stable even as demand changes.

---

## **1. Transport systems**

- Rail infrastructure (track, signalling, tunnels, bridges)
- Rolling stock amortisation
- Station operation and maintenance
- Regional and local bus networks
- Road network (national, cantonal, municipal)
- Winter services
- Traffic control systems

**Cost characteristics:**

- high fixed share
- scale-sensitive
- population-distribution dependent

---

## **2. Energy systems**

- Electricity grid (high/medium/low-voltage layers)
- Transformer stations
- Maintenance of hydroelectric assets
- District heating/cooling networks
- Emergency reserve capacity

**Cost characteristics:**

- capacity-driven
- partly weather-dependent
- slow to downscale

---

## **3. Water and waste systems**

- Drinking-water networks
- Treatment plants
- Sewage systems and pumping stations
- Stormwater infrastructure
- Waste collection and sorting logistics

**Cost characteristics:**

- non-linear cost behaviour
- vulnerable to underuse
- asset-heavy

---

## **4. Health infrastructure**

- Hospitals (acute, regional, university)
- Long-term care facilities
- Emergency services
- Diagnostic and laboratory networks

**Cost characteristics:**

- baseline capacity needed independent of population growth
- regional redundancy required

---

## **5. Education infrastructure**

- School buildings and campuses
- Teaching staff baselines
- Technical and vocational training facilities
- University campuses and research infrastructure

**Cost characteristics:**

- cohort-sensitive
- low flexibility to shrink
- long amortisation periods

---

## **6. Administrative and governance systems**

- Registry and identity services
- Tax administration
- Civil protection and emergency coordination
- Digital public infrastructure (platforms, registers, APIs)

**Cost characteristics:**

- often fixed regardless of demography
- can be reduced through harmonisation, not shrinkage

---

## **7. Housing and urban systems**

- Local services (lighting, waste sites, parks)
- Public space maintenance
- Urban transport connectors
- Social infrastructure (libraries, youth centres, community halls)

**Cost characteristics:**

- distributed
- sensitive to density declines
- difficult to consolidate without political cost

---

## **8. Financial and institutional linkages**

- Pension system baselines
- Insurance pools
- Municipal and cantonal revenue structures
- Debt service obligations

**Cost characteristics:**

- reliant on stable contributor bases
- sensitive to demographic plateaus
- slow-moving but high-impact

---

## **9. Fixed-cost exposure indicators**

*(non-normative)*

- minimum viable capacity thresholds
- dependency on population density
- asset rigidity / downscale resistance
- maintenance-to-utilisation ratios
- regional duplication levels
- scaling elasticity

---

## **10. Open questions**

- Which infrastructures are most sensitive to plateau conditions?
- Where do per-capita costs rise fastest under stagnation?
- How do federatedRelated: post-growth institutional dynamics. structures amplify or buffer fixed-cost stress?
- What forms of innovation reduce exposure without centralisation?
- How can value flow be aligned with infrastructure benefit?
