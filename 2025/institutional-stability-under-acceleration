# **Institutional Stability Under Acceleration – Draft**

Short structural note.

Not a proposal. Not an agenda.

Just a model.

---

## **1. Core idea**

When technological cycles accelerate faster than political cycles, stability depends less on regulation and more on institutional capacity: the ability of public systems to absorb, interpret and adapt to faster change without altering their fundamental structure.

---

## **2. Problem frame**

Most democracies operate on slow cycles:

- long consultation phases
- sequential legislation
- limited analytical bandwidth
- low procedural flexibility

Fast-moving environments introduce three tensions:

1. **Cognitive mismatch:** information volume > processing capacity
2. **Coordination mismatch:** interdependent systems adapt at different speeds
3. **Sequence mismatch:** political decisions occur after structural shifts, not before

The result is not failure, but friction.

---

## **3. Stabilising layer (non-normative)**

Possible mechanisms that reduce friction without altering rights or democratic structure:

- **Information architecture:** structured summaries, machine-readable inputs, scenario ranges
- **Technical capacity:** minimal in-house competence for analysis, auditing, and monitoring
- **Procedural flexibility:** modular regulations with periodic review, limited pilots, sunset clauses
- **Cognitive relief:** simplified administrative flows, pre-validated documentation
- **Resilience buffers:** shared standards in critical infrastructure, stress-tested fallback modes

These mechanisms do not accelerate politics.

They reduce the cost of slowness.

---

## **4. Boundary conditions**

- no alteration of democratic rights
- no centralisation of political power
- no discretionary screening of content
- transparent, non-interpretative criteria
- low administrative overhead
- compatibility with federal structures

---

## **5. Failure modes**

- perceived centralisation
- low trust in technical layers
- unclear accountability
- capture by interest groups
- increased procedural opacity
- insufficient public communication

---

## **6. Structural progression (non-predictive)**

*(non-linear, optional, non-prescriptive)*

- clearer information → lower cognitive load
- lower cognitive load → higher decision stability
- higher decision stability → less systemic noise
- less systemic noise → greater institutional resilience under acceleration

These are interactions, not outcomes.

---

## **7. Open questions**

- What minimal institutional capacity prevents forced emergency measures?
- Which information structures remain stable across rapid change?
- How do load profiles differ between federal, cantonal and municipal levels?
- Which procedural elements scale without centralisation?
- How can trust be maintained in technical layers without increasing opacity?
