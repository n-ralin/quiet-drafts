# Land Value Shift – Draft

A quiet experiment exploring how a gradual adjustment of tax weight
—from labour to land value—could reduce structural inequality without
triggering economic flight or political polarisation.

This draft is not a proposal.
It is a thought model.

## Core idea
- Lower taxes on income and productive work.
- Slightly higher taxes on land value and unearned gains.
- Revenue-neutral.
- Simple.
- Mechanically fairer.

## Why this matters
Productive work becomes easier.
Speculation becomes slightly less attractive.
The gap between owners and non-owners grows slower.
The system becomes less fragile.

## Questions to explore
- What are the minimal parameters for neutrality?
- How strong is the behavioural impact?
- Which transition periods avoid shocks?
- How does this interact with existing Swiss cantonal tax models?

(Work in progress.)
