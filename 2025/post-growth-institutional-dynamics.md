# **Post-Growth Institutional Dynamics – Draft**

A quiet structural note on how institutions behave when load grows but scale advantages recede.

---

## **1. Core idea**

- Institutions designed for population growth face structural stress under stagnation.
- Fixed-cost infrastructures become costlier per capita.
- Growth-dependent revenue models become unstable.
- High-value sectors retain incentives for expansion even when populations plateau.
- Alternative funding and coordination logics reduce systemic fragility.

---

## **2. Why it matters**

Most public systems rely implicitly on demographic expansion for cost distribution, financial stability and narrative legitimacy.

As long-term stagnation becomes more likely, institutional design must adjust to operate without growth pressure.

---

## **3. Minimal conditions**

- Stable fixed-cost mapping across sectors
- Clear delineation between variable and non-variable cost components
- Transparent inter-cantonal coordination standards
- Non-demographic funding channels for core infrastructure
- Innovation focused on system-level efficiency rather than scale expansion

---

## **4. Potential failure modes**

- Infrastructure undersupply due to declining cost-sharing bases
- Increased political pressure toward unsustainable growth narratives
- Lobby-driven distortions (real estate, finance, construction)
- Over-centralisation risks and corruption exposure
- Regional divergence due to asymmetric impact of stagnation
- Delayed automation causing labour shortages to become structural
- Interoperability layers may become brittle as scale economies weaken

---

## **5. Solution pathways**

*(non-prescriptive; structural options)*

- **A. Technical harmonisation** without political centralisation
- **B. Funding models derived from realised value capture** rather than headcount growth
- **C. Cost-degression via energy and infrastructure redesign**
- **D. Automation to stabilise labour requirements**
- **E. Controlled decentralised experimentation** to identify resilient patterns

---

## **6. Open questions**

- How do fixed-cost infrastructures behave under prolonged plateau conditions?
- Which sectors can transition to value-capture-based funding without distortions?
- How resilient are federated structures under reduced scale economies?
- Which innovation domains yield the highest reduction in institutional load?
- What are early indicators of narrative misalignment or trust decay?
- How can coordination improve without reducing local autonomy?
