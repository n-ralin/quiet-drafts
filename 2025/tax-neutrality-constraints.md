# Tax Neutrality Constraints – Draft

A short note describing the minimal conditions under which
a shift from labour taxation to land-value-related taxation
remains revenue-neutral and behaviourally stable.

This is not a proposal.
It is a structural sketch.

## 1. Revenue neutrality
A shift must ensure:
- total tax intake remains stable within a narrow band
- yearly fluctuations stay below existing variance
- cantonal autonomy is preserved

Key requirement:  
Δ(land value tax) ≈ –Δ(labour tax)

## 2. Behavioural stability
The reform must not trigger:
- relocation incentives
- speculative timing strategies
- rapid conversion of land holdings
- distortions between cantonal models

Minimal safeguard:
gradual phase-in over 10–15 years.

## 3. Administrative feasibility
The shift must rely on:
- existing land registry data
- periodic revaluation schedules (already in use)
- no major new bureaucracy

Aim:
use what exists.

## 4. Predictability for households
Households must have:
- long horizon visibility
- capped yearly adjustments
- clear formulas based on cadastral values

Predictability reduces behavioural shocks.

## 5. Interaction with income brackets
Lower labour taxes should:
- benefit low and mid incomes first
- remain simple (few brackets)
- avoid marginal rate cliffs

Primary goal:
reduce inequality without new complexity.

## 6. Stress tests
Before implementation:
- simulate normal years
- simulate recession
- simulate housing market shocks
- simulate regional divergence

If core metrics remain stable:
model is viable.

(Work in progress.)
