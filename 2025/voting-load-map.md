# **Voting Load Map – Draft**

A small structural map of cognitive load in direct-democracy systems.

---

## **1. Cognitive load**

Mechanisms that increase or reduce individual mental effort during voting.

- number of parallel proposals
- textual complexity
- ambiguity of legal consequences
- volume of campaign claims
- contradictory expert interpretations
- insufficient differentiation between alternatives
- lack of structural summaries
- absence of scenario ranges
- unfamiliar terminology
- multi-level tradeoffs (federal / cantonal / sectoral)

**Load indicators:**

- time required to understand a proposal
- reliance on heuristic cues
- reported uncertainty before voting

---

## **2. Information load**

Density, quality and navigability of available information.

- length of official documentation
- degree of fragmentation across sources
- inconsistency between administrative and campaign narratives
- missing baseline data
- missing impact models
- overreliance on anecdotal framing
- mixed normative and descriptive language
- unclear mapping of affected groups
- absence of comparable metrics across proposals

**Load indicators:**

- source multiplicity
- internal contradiction density
- share of unverifiable claims

---

## **3. Procedural load**

Administrative and temporal factors that shape decision friction.

- ballot design and physical handling
- frequency of voting cycles
- scheduling proximity of complex issues
- simultaneous federal and cantonal proposals
- unclear sequencing between initiative, referendum, and counterproposal
- short consolidation period between Committee messaging and official materials
- inconsistent terminology across ballots

**Load indicators:**

- error rates in ballot completion
- need for repeated clarification
- procedural misalignment between levels

---

## **4. Narrative load**

Competing stories, identities and emotional frames.

- dual interpretability of proposal intent
- activation of threat frames (“risk”, “loss”, “danger”)
- activation of moral frames (“solidarity”, “fairness”, “duty”)
- personalised conflicts between actors
- historical analogies used as proxies
- symbolic overloading (“Zeichen setzen”, “Schicksalsabstimmung”)

**Load indicators:**

- emotional intensity of campaigns
- divergence between mechanism and story
- reliance on identity instead of structure

---

## **5. Systemic load**

Accumulated strain on democratic infrastructure.

- rising number of poorly drafted proposals
- unpredictable sequencing
- mismatch between legislative capacity and initiative volume
- parallel mobilisations by interest organisations
- declining trust in information intermediaries
- overuse of referendum as strategic tool
- asymmetry in campaign resources

**Load indicators:**

- long-term abstention levels
- volatility in vote shares
- increasing post-vote litigation
- declining perceived legitimacy of outcomes

---

## **6. Structural progression (non-predictive)**

- high cognitive + information load → increased reliance on heuristics
- increased heuristics → higher volatility of outcomes
- high procedural + narrative load → reduced participation
- reduced participation → weaker mandate signals
- weaker mandate signals → greater downstream conflict

These interactions are optional, non-linear, and context-dependent.

---

## **7. Open questions**

- Which load dimensions most strongly predict abstention?
- How do load profiles differ across demographic groups?
- Which upstream interventions reduce narrative load without limiting political expression?
- How resilient ist the system to cumulative load over multiple cycles?
- What is the minimal information architecture required for stable decision quality?
