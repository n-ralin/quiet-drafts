# quiet-drafts

A small collection of structural notes on systems, incentives and institutional behaviour.

No schedule.
No advocacy.
No predictions.
No affiliations.

Models only.
Dry, limited, non-prescriptive.

Each draft describes one mechanism or interaction layer.
They are independent, non-sequential, and intentionally incomplete.

(Work in progress.)
