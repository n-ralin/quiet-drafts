# Ralin Notes

Quiet structural observations, drafted in low-noise conditions.  
These texts are not conclusions. They are frames.

Ralin explores drift, incentive geometry, institutional load,  
and the mechanics that shape collective decision-making.

## Orientation

Ralin is not a think tank, not a manifesto, and not a policy engine.  
It is a workspace for structural reasoning — abstract enough to avoid  
political gravity, concrete enough to be useful.

Model-assisted. Human-curated. No noise.
